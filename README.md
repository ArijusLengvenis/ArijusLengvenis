## üî® Current Projects

- **Automated HPL Benchmarking**: I'm currently working on Python scripts to automate the High-Performance Linpack (HPL) benchmarking process. This includes setting up compilers, installing Message Passing (MP) and Linear Algebra (LA) libraries, conducting an optimal parameter search using Optuna, storing results in Prometheus, and visualising results in a dedicated dashboard. This work aims to streamline preparations for future Student Cluster Competitions (SCC) and allow participants to focus on more critical tasks.

- **Parallel Euclidean TSP Solver**: As part of my 4th-year project, I'm developing a parallel solver for the Euclidean Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for very large instances (n > 10^6). Leveraging my experience from SCC and my upcoming guest student programme at the J√ºlich Supercomputing Centre (JSC), I'm constructing a modular, parallel divide-and-conquer framework to handle large TSP datasets. The project is aimed to "help Santa deliver presents around the world", and would provide practical benefits for logistics and delivery company contexts.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Coding Competitions

I enjoy participating in various coding competitions such as [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) and [VarsityCode](https://www.showcode.io/varsitycode) for fast, out-of-the-box thinking challenges. I also participate in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) to sharpen my problem-solving skills, algorithm and data structure knowledge, and learn new tips and tricks.

## üöÄ Hobbies and Interests

When I'm not immersed in coding or studying, I enjoy:
- Playing tennis.
- Engaging in chess theory (and gameplay).
- Participating in quizzes (obviously).
- Constantly learning new things.

I truly enjoy engaging in brainstorming sessions and discussing intriguing ideas, even when they seem too ambitious for our abilities.
